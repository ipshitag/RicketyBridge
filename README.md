# RicketyBridge
The age old rickety bridge problem

Adam, Bob, Clair and Dave are out walking: They come to rickety old wooden bridge. The bridge is weak and only able to carry the weight of two of them at a time. Because they are in a rush and the light is fading they must all have crossed the bridge in 60 minutes and must carry a torch (flashlight,) on each crossing. They only have one torch and it can't be thrown. Because of their different fitness levels and some minor injuries they can all cross at different speeds. Adam can cross in 5 minutes, Bob in 10 minutes, Clair in 20 minutes and Dave in 25 minutes. How do they manage to cross the river in time?
